      <!-- l. 114 --><p class='indent'>     Evariste      Galois      was      a      brilliantly      original
      French mathematician. Born shortly before Napoleon’s ill-fated
      invasion of Russia, he died shortly before the ill-fated uprising
      in Paris. His last words: ’Don’t cry, I need all my courage to die
      at 20’.
      </p><!-- l. 116 --><p class='indent'>   Galois grew up in a time and place confused and excited by
      revolution. He was known to say ’if I were only sure that a body
      would be enough to incite the people to revolt, I would offer
      mine’. On May 2 1832, after frustration over failure in love and
      failure to convince the Paris math establishment of the depth
      of his ideas, he made his decision. A duel was arranged with a
      friend, but only his friend’s gun would be loaded. Galois died
      the day after a bullet perforated his intestine. At his funeral it
      was discovered that a famous general had also just died, and the
      revolutionaries decided to use the general’s death rather than
      Galois’ as a pretext for an armed uprising. A few days later the
      streets of Paris were blocked by barricades, but not because of
      Galois’ sacrifice: his death had been pointless.</p></blockquote>
